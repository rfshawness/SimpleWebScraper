If Google is the gold standard, then Bing is copper at best!  When looking at the average Spearman coefficient of -6.16, being a negative number significantly less than -1, the statistical difference between the resulting URL's from each query are very clearly not correlated. Similarly when I look at the average percentage overlap of 0.22, it is clear that Bing does not return the relevant pages even remotely close to the level of Google. With a low 20 percentage average percentage you are a return and a large negative Spearman coefficient, it is clear mathematically that there is a large gap between these two search engines.
